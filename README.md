# Restaurant-locator-system
This is a web-based tourism site for London, highlighting halal restaurants to cater to specific dietary needs and promote cultural awareness. It features restaurant locations, transport links, menus, and reviews, aiming to deliver a seamless user experience for tourists and hobbyists. A unique "Healthy Eats" button directs users to a page where they can enter their health goals (e.g., Lose weight, Maintain, Gain) and basic biometric data (weight, height, age). Based on this, a BMI is calculated to provide restaurants and meals in London that align with their health goals. Users click on their BMI range to view personalised restaurants. This feature enhances user engagement with tailored dietary suggestions and showcases innovation in the website.
